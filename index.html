<h2> <u>About Stefan Gordon</u> </h2>
<p> Hello, my name is Stefan Gordon. I am from Atlanta, Georgia and I am 21 years old. I orignally lived in a small town in Gwinnett called Lilburn. I went to Parkview High School, then went to Kennesaw State University. After staying at Kennesaw for 2 years I transferred to the University of Georgia and I am now in my first semester here. I plan on majoring in accounting and minoring in Criminal Justice with hopes to become a Forensic Accountant one day. I enjoy playing soccer and basketball in my free time and I also enjoy spending time with friends and family whenever I come home. Being in college has taught me to branch out and get to know different people, but also not forgetting about the people I grew up with. </p>

<h2> <u>Greatest Accomplishment</u> </h2>
<p> I started playing soccer when I was 12. I started off in the rec league and soon moved up to play in a more competitve league. Growing up I would always win small trophies at tournaments, but never anything big. Once I got to high school I started playing for my high school team and became a starter on varsity. We got close to winning state our junior year, but lost in the Final Four. After that loss I thought about quitting and just playing for fun. I decided I wouldn't quit and that I would return to play my senior year. My senior year we ended up winning the state championship and becoming one of the best teams in the country.</p>

<h2> <u>Forensic Accounting</u> </h2>
<p> Forensic Accounting hasn't always been my first choice of a career. At first I wanted to become a detective after witnessing some detective work in New York. It was interesting at first but after doing some research, I found Forensic Accounting very interesting. I've always found shows such as Criminal Minds interesting because some of the people in the show deal with fraud and managing companies' books. It has become something that I've really grown an interest for and I'm hoping to do some work in the field soon.</p>
